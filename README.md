# metalearning-dance-retargeting
Created for IE 643 Course Project in collaboration with Priyanshu.
For the novelty part, 
1)we have tried to implement our old generator by adding residual blocks to preserve spatial features. 
2)We also tried to implement GAN with multilevel generators one known as local and other as global generator in addition to this we also have residual blocks for preserving the spatial features at multiple levels.
3)We thought of implementing multilevel discriminators too but that would have increased our model complexity to large extent.
